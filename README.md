# GIB-LSTM
Semantic representation and attention alignment for Graph Information Bottleneck in video summarization  
======
Introduction
-------
We adopted the Graph Information Bottle (GIB) to develop a Contextual Feature Transformation (CFT) mechanism that refines the temporal two-stream feature, yielding a semantic representation with attention alignment. Furthermore, a novel Salient-Area-Size-based spatial attention model is presented to extract frame-wise visual features based on
the observation that humans tend to focus on sizable and moving objects. Finally, semantic representation is embedded within attention alignment under the end-to-end LSTM framework to differentiate indistinguishable images.
